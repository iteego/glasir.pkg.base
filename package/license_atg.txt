2. 	OWNERSHIP; SECURITY 
2.1 	Ownership. The Licensed Programs furnished under this Agreement are licensed, not 
sold, to Licensee.  Licensee agrees and acknowledges that ATG and its suppliers possess all right, 
title and interest in and to the Licensed Programs, trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade

the Licensed Programs for the benefit of any other person or entity, or permit any third party to 
make such use, and (b) Licensee shall have no other rights or licenses with respect to the 
Licensed Programs (including rights under any patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or 
other intellectual property rights of ATG).  Licensee shall not obscure, alter or remove any patent, 
copyright, trademark, service mark or other marking or legend contained on or in any Licensed 
Programs. 
2.2 	Security. Licensee shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard and segregate the Licensed

violation of this Agreement if taken by Licensee. Such steps shall include, but shall not be limited 
to, imposing password restrictions on use of the Licensed Programs, securing Licensee's network 
on which such Licensed Program resides from outside intrusion, and administering and 
monitoring use of the Licensed Programs. Licensee shall promptly report to ATG any actual or 
suspected violation of this Section 2, and shall take such further steps as may reasonably be 
requested by ATG to prevent or remedy any such violation. 
2.3 	Injunctive Relief. Licensee specifically agrees that (a) in the event that a material breach 
by Licensee of its obligations under Section 1 or Section 2 occurs or appears likely to occur, ATG 
will be entitled to an injunction or similar equitable relief ordering the cessation of such breach 
immediately upon request to a court of competent jurisdiction without having to post bond or 
show anything other than the fact that such breach has occurred or is likely to occur, and 
(b) Licensee hereby waives all defenses related thereto. 
3. 	NO WARRANTY; LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY 
3.1 	THE LICENSED PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ATG MAKES NO 
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, BY OPERATION OF LAW OR OTHERWISE, 
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THOSE OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO REPRESENTATION OR 
OTHER AFFIRMATION OF FACT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO STATEMENTS 
REGARDING CAPACITY, SUITABILITY FOR USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE 
LICENSED PROGRAM, WHETHER MADE BY ATG EMPLOYEES OR OTHERWISE WILL 
BE DEEMED TO BE A WARRANTY BY ATG FOR ANY PURPOSE OR GIVE RISE TO 
ANY LIABILITY OF ATG WHATSOEVER. 
3.2 	ATG will not be liable for any loss or damage claimed to have been suffered or incurred 
by Licensee or any third person as a result of the use of the Licensed Program by or on behalf of 
Licensee regardless of the circumstances or form of action (including negligence). 
3.3 	Downloading software from the Internet contains inherent risks. Without limiting the 
foregoing, ATG makes no warranty that the Licensed Programs are free from computer viruses, 
errors, time bombs, trojan horses or other harmful or malicious code. ATG has not implemented 
scanning or security measures to prevent the introduction of such code into the Licensed 
Programs. 
3.4 	The Licensed Program is not part of ATG's support and maintenance program and is not 
certified on ATG's supported platform lists. Without limitation, ATG will have no obligation to 
support, maintain or provide updates or upgrades to the License Program. Licensee acknowledges 
that ATG will not provide any updates, upgrades, patches, bug fixes, or any other support and 
maintenance services in any manner.
4. 	TERMINATION 
This Agreement will be terminated: (i) automatically if Licensee breaches any provision of this 
Agreement; (ii) by Licensee or ATG for any reason upon notice to the other party; and (iii) 
automatically if any assignment is made by Licensee for the benefit of creditors, or if a receiver, 
trustee in bankruptcy or similar officer shall be appointed to take charge of any or all of 
Licensee's property, or if Licensee files a voluntary petition under federal bankruptcy laws or 
similar state or foreign statutes or such a petition is filed against Licensee. Upon any termination 
of this Agreement, all rights and licenses of Licensee shall immediately cease and terminate, and 
Licensee shall certify to ATG that Licensee has destroyed or erased all copies of the Licensed 
Programs in Licensee's control or possession. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the 
foregoing, the provisions of Sections 2.1 and 3 shall survive termination of this Agreement. 
5. 	MISCELLANEOUS 
5.1 	Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between ATG and 
Licensee with respect to its subject matter. No addendum, waiver, consent, modification, 
amendment or change of the terms of this Agreement shall bind ATG unless in writing and signed 
by a duly authorized officer of ATG. 
5.2 	Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of 
competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it is invalid or in conflict with any law of any 
relevant jurisdiction, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected, and the rights 
and obligations of the parties shall be construed and enforced as if the Agreement did not contain 
the particular provisions held to be unenforceable, unless such construction would materially alter 
the meaning of this Agreement. 
5.3 	Assignment. Licensee may not assign this Agreement nor any of the rights, obligations or 
licenses granted hereunder without the prior written consent of ATG. For purposes of this 
Section, a merger, acquisition or change of control of Licensee shall be deemed to be an 
assignment. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of ATG and its successors and assigns. 
5.4 	Governing Law. The validity, construction and interpretation of this Agreement, and the 
rights and duties of the parties, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A., without giving effect to the conflict of law 
provisions thereof, and excluding any application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts 
for the International Sale of Goods. Each party irrevocably (a) agrees that any action or 
proceeding arising from or relating to this Agreement may be brought only in the courts of 
Massachusetts or the U.S. District Court located in Boston, Massachusetts, (b) consents, for itself 
and in respect of its property, to the jurisdiction of each such court in any such action or 
proceeding, and (c) waives any objection to proceeding in such venue, including that the forum is 
inconvenient. 
5.5 	No Waiver. The waiver by ATG of a breach of a default of any provision of this 
Agreement by Licensee shall not be construed as a waiver of any succeeding breach of the same 
or any other provision, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of ATG to exercise or avail 
itself of any right, power or privilege that it has, or may have hereunder, operate as a waiver of 
any right, power or privilege by ATG. 
5.6 	No Publication. Licensee agrees that it shall not have the right to publish or 
otherwise disclose any information or conclusions resulting from the testing performed 
on, or from the use of, the Licensed Products except with the prior written permission of 
ATG. Such approval, if granted, may be subject to reasonable alterations and deletions, 
and may be reasonably delayed for patent or business considerations in ATG's sole discretion. 
5.7	Export Compliance. Regardless of whether Licensee is a US-based entity, Licensee shall 
not export or re-export any of the Licensed Programs (in whole or in part) to any country without 
ensuring that such export complies with the Export Administration Regulations of the U.S. 
Department of Commerce, or any other agency of the U.S. Government, or similar laws 
governing the export of software or products of any other government having jurisdiction over 
such export, re-export, or use, pursuant to any applicable statute, regulation, or governmental 
order.  Licensee must remain at all times in full compliance with U.S. Government export policy 
and regulations and failure of such compliance shall constitute a material breach of this 
Agreement.
5.8	Government Rights. If the Licensed Programs are licensed by or on behalf of a unit or 
agency of the United States government, the Licensee agrees that the Licensed Program is 
"commercial computer software" or "commercial computer software documentation" subject to 
RESTRICTED RIGHTS limited by the terms of this Agreement. Use, duplication or disclosure 
by the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in FAR §12.212(a) or DFARS 
§227.7202-1(a). The manufacturer is Art Technology Group, Inc., One Main Street, Cambridge,
